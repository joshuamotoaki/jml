This is my first blog post. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about technology, design, and life in general. Topics might include:

- Software engineering and architecture
- Human-computer interaction
- Creative coding and generative art
- Reflections on learning and growth

## Why write?

Writing clarifies thinking. It forces you to articulate ideas that might otherwise remain fuzzy intuitions. And occasionally, something you write might resonate with someone else.

That quote on my homepage isn't just decoration. It reflects how I try to approach problems—seeing connections where others might see boundaries.
