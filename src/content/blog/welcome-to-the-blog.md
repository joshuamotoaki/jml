This blog is where I publish notes about building software with clarity and intent.

## What to expect

- Practical engineering write-ups.
- Thoughts on product and infrastructure tradeoffs.
- Occasional field notes from current projects.

## Why Markdown

Markdown keeps publishing friction low and lets the content stay portable.

```ts
export function ship(value: string) {
  return `Build, learn, and iterate: ${value}`;
}
```
